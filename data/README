* NOTE: These are the typical data that will be used to test your code 
  for grading. Other more obscure test cases may be used during grading. 

1. CSV data set #1, with different quote character and delimiters, 
   and how to be rendered

dat-doublequote-comma.csv
dat-doublequote-tab.csv

dat.png   # Note: no need to show column and row legend (A, B, C,... 1, 2, 3)

2. CSV data set #2,  with different quote character and delimiters, 
   and how to be rendered

dat2-doublequote-comma.csv
dat2-doublequote-tab.csv
dat2-singlequote-tab.csv

dat2.png   # Note: no need to show column and row legend (A, B, C,... 1, 2, 3)

3. markdown example text, and how to be rendered (in github, click on [raw])

markdown.md  : when you click, you will see the correct rendering in github.
markdown.pdf : a rough appearance
